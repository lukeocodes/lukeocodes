# Hello, folks!

I'm Luke, and I am a Developer Experience Engineer.


I am a Senior Developer Experience Engineer at Deepgram, a leading provider of language AI solutions for developers. I have over 10 years years of experience in developer relations, engineering, and consulting, working with various technologies and frameworks in the Jamstack ecosystem.

My core competencies include agile development, software engineering, and business research. I help lead the Developer Experience team's strategy and initiatives, collaborating closely with product, engineering, and digital marketing teams. I also help define and build the developer community, and contribute to the open-source projects that enable Deepgram to work seamlessly with any audio application. My mission is to make world-class language AI available to any developer through just an API call.
